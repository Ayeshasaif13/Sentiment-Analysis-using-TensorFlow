# Sentiment Analysis Using TensorFlow

**AI-Driven Financial Insights: Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow**

- Developed by Diogo Alves de Resende

## Project Overview

As a data scientist at **FinInsight Solutions**, a leader in financial technology, you have been assigned a crucial task: developing a **sentiment analysis model** to track market trends. The **Product Analytics team** relies on your expertise to extract insights from financial news and social media. Using **TensorFlow**, you will process vast amounts of text data, identifying sentiment patterns that influence investment decisions.

This project is a key initiative for the company, highlighted in the CTO's quarterly objectives. Your goal is to create a **highly accurate and scalable sentiment analysis model** that seamlessly integrates into the existing analytics workflow, enhancing data-driven investment strategies.

## Objectives

- Analyze sentence length variations using histograms to assess data complexity.
- Use word frequency analysis with **Counter** and **Seaborn** to identify common language patterns.
- Extract and visualize **bi-grams** to understand key phrases in the dataset.
- Perform **basic sentiment analysis** to evaluate the distribution of positive and negative words.
- Apply **text preprocessing techniques** (tokenization, cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization) for model preparation.
- Build a **baseline neural network** with TensorFlow/Keras for sentiment classification.
- Optimize model performance with **Keras Tuner** for better accuracy.
- Develop and save a **final tuned neural network**, ensuring best practices in model selection and persistence.

## Required Skills

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Text Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

## Task Overview

Your main task is to build and train a **TensorFlow-based sentiment analysis model** using the provided dataset. The project environment has been pre-configured, and all necessary data and documentation are available in the repository.

Ensure that your model adheres to company **coding standards**, is well-documented, and is **integration-ready** for deployment in FinInsight Solutionsâ€™ analytics suite.
